      <h2>How Carbonless Community Works</h2>
      <p>Carbonless Community provides an accounting of daily positive actions members of a university community (or that of a corporation or other community group) take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and, thus, the university's carbon footprint. A point value is assigned to each positive action based on its ability to reduce GHG emissions. Through use of Carbonless Community's website and iPhone App, students, employees, faculty and staff can track their daily activities that promote a healthy environment and see how these activities directly contribute to a reduction in their school's carbon footprint by watching the points accumulate.</p>
      <p>Each participant in Carbonless Community has a personal score, which also contributes to the overall score of her university (or other community group). With the CC Tracker, Carbonless Community's iPhone App, participants can log their pro-environmental actions as they go about their daily lives and get immediate positive feedback as their personal scores, and that of their school, increase.</p>
      <h3>Competition and Cooperation</h3>
      <p>Carbonless Community's online resources can be used by an individual member of a community to watch his positive actions accumulate and see how his efforts compare to other members'. However, the most benefit from Carbonless Community will be gained when members of the university (or corporation, organization, etc.) team up into groups that compete with each other to accumulate the most points.</p>
      <p>Teams can challenge each other on a monthly or weekly basis and monitor their efforts online. Teams with greater competitive ambition will benefit from the CC Tracker, which will allow them to check a team's status from anywhere and at any time.</p>
      <p>Competition among the groups and teams is vital in making environmental actions exciting, but equally important is cooperation within one's group. Beyond the obvious benefits gained by rooting on one's teammates, when certain positive actions are taken together by teammates, their point values increase exponentially. This is because the creators of Carbonless Community believe that a necessary component of saving our environment is getting people to work together.</p>
