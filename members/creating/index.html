            <h1>Creating a Community is easy!</h1>

            <p class="lead">All you need is a committed group of at least 100 individuals who have ties to a single organization. For example, your community could be a college or university with the community’s “members” being faculty, staff and students and their immediate and extended families. Or your community could be your company (with members being employees and their immediate and extended families). We understand that individuals have varying abilities to reduce their impact on the planet, but we ask each member to commit to doing the best they can in reducing carbon emissions by signing the Carbonless Community Commitment. The easiest and most cost-efficient measure for reducing one’s carbon footprint is to purchase energy-efficient appliances when it is time to replace your current washer, dishwasher, TV, etc. Choosing the right energy-efficient equipment will not only save you money over time but will also reduce your impact on the planet.</p>

            <h4>There are several reasons to create your own Carbonless Community:</h4>
            <p class="lead"> <ol><li>Community members will receive great pricing and customer service when they purchase an appliance through the Abt link below</li>
            <li>Your student group will receive revenue on the appliance purchases, which will help further your groups mission</li>
            <li>You will be helping your organization (school, college or company) reduce its carbon footprint through the carbon offsets you provide (and at no cost to your organization)</li>
                </ol></p>
