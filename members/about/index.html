            <h1>Reducing your carbon footprint is easy – and can save you money!</h1>

            <p class="lead">Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, most notably carbon dioxide (CO2), does not have to be difficult nor does it have to be costly.  The mission of Carbonless Community is to assist groups of like-minded people in executing easy and thoughtful measures that not only reduce their personal carbon footprints, but also reduce the carbon footprint of the larger community to which they belong – all the while, saving money.  Carbonless Community expands your organization’s activities to include specific carbon avoidance measures taken by employees, staff, faculty, students and their immediate and extended families. </p>
