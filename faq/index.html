<p class="accordion"><b>1. Q: What are Carbon Offsets?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: Carbon Offsets are quantifiable reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The reductions can be used
to mitigate an organization’s Scope 1, 2 or 3 emissions in an organization’s Carbon Footprint accounting. The
projects are limitless in scope and location. From the US EPA and World Resource Institute, <b><i>“An offset project is “a
specific activity or set of activities intended to reduce GHG emissions….the
resulting emissions reductions must be real, permanent, and verified.” “Offsets
can be used in addition to an organization taking actions within its own
operational boundary to lower emissions. Offsets are often used for meeting
voluntary commitments to lower GHG emissions where it is not feasible to lower
an organization’s direct or indirect emissions.”</i></b></div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>2. Q: What are we buying when we buy Carbon Offsets?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: When you buy Carbon Offsets, you are buying one metric tonne (i.e., 1,000 kg or 2,205 lbs) of CO<sub>2</sub>
equivalent emissions that have been captured, destroyed or avoided being discharged into the earth’s
atmosphere. The money you spend on the Carbon Offset is necessary for the project to be successful.
The offsets you are buying have already been secured and verified by a certified third party.</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>3. Q: What/who are the third-party project verifiers for your Carbon Offset projects?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: Third party verifiers of our projects include (but are not limited to):
<ul>
    <li>Gold Standard</li>
    <li>American Carbon Registry</li>
    <li>Verra (aka, Verified Carbon Standard)</li>
    <li>Climate Action Reserve</li>
    <li>CSA</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>4. Q: Can we use Carbon Offsets like we use RECs?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: <b>YES.</b> The US EPA states in their published literature that Carbon Offsets can be used for offsetting
Scope 2 electricity purchases – which is what RECs do (i.e., offset/mitigate Scope 2 electricity
purchases). <i><b>See EPA Green Power Partnership circular, “RECs and Offsets – What’s the Difference”:</b></i>
<u><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-03/documents/gpp_guide_recs_offsets.pdf">https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-03/documents/gpp_guide_recs_offsets.pdf</a></u>. Also,
according to the EPA, the World Resource Institute and Second Nature, the reporting agency for
the Presidents’ Climate Commitments, Carbon Offsets can mitigate all Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions
(including electricity purchases), in your carbon footprint accounting.</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>5. Q: How much have RECs increased in price over the past two years?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: Two years ago, generic RECs cost between $0.65 and $0.90. The current price (as of January, 2022)
the price for generic RECs in the voluntary is $6.00/MWh – more than a six-fold increase!</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>6. Q: If Carbon Offsets are $10.00 per MT CO<sub>2</sub>e and RECs in the voluntary market are $6.00,
how are Carbon Offsets cheaper?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: Both Carbon Offsets and RECs can be used in Carbon Footprint accounting to offset/mitigate the
emissions associated with the electricity being consumed by your facility. There are 26 different
electricity regions in the continental US and each has a different quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per
MWh (Mega-Watt hour) of electricity consumed. The New England and Mid-Atlantic regions (with
the exception of facilities on Long Island) have less than 333 Kgs (i.e., one-third metric tonne) of
CO<sub>2</sub> associated with the generation of one MWh of electricity. So in your carbon footprint
accounting, one REC offsets a maximum of 333 kgs of CO<sub>2</sub> , while one Carbon Offset mitigates 1,000
kgs – or three times as much CO<sub>2</sub> . On a carbon accounting equivalent, the cost of mitigating one
tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> costs $10.00 with Carbon Offsets, but the cost of mitigating on tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> with RECs
is $18.00 (i.e., three times $6.00). The specific areas and the associated equivalents are shown
below.</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>7. Q: What are the savings of buying Carbon Offsets over RECs for mitigating/offsetting Scope 2 electricity purchases?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: Shown in the table below are the savings of buying Carbon Offsets over RECs for electricity purchases in various electricity grid areas in the eastern US:

<p class="accordion"><b>8. Q: What emissions can Carbon Offsets mitigate in our Carbon Footprint accounting?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: Carbon Offsets can be used to offset/mitigate any Greenhouse Gas emission from your
facility whether it is a Scope 1, Scope 2 or Scope 3 emission. Carbon Offsets can mitigate onsite fossil
fuel burning for heating, vehicle fleet transportation, commuting, etc. Carbon Offsets are one-stop
shopping for your carbon mitigation requirements.</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>9. Q: Can Carbon Offsets be used instead of cheaper, generic RECs in REC Arbitrage (aka, REC Swap)?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: From the perspective of your carbon footprint accounting – <b>most definitely, YES. <i><font color="#4088B4">Per the US EPA:
“REC arbitrage occurs when RECs from one renewable electricity project are sold and replaced by less
expensive RECs.…”</font></i></b> A REC Swap is typically undertaken to take fullest advantage of higher-priced Solar
RECs (SRECs), by selling them and buying cheaper generic RECs, in order to make a solar project
economically viable. This maneuver not only enhances project economics, but also maintains the
project’s carbon reduction goals. But the suggested replacement vehicle (i.e., generic RECs) are
treated the same as Carbon Offsets with regard to your carbon footprint accounting. <b><i>So why not use
the less costly Carbon Offsets instead of the generic RECs; thereby, enhancing your solar project’s
economics to a greater extent? You will be doing a SREC—Carbon Offset Swap!</i></b></div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>10. Q: Which institutions use Carbon Offsets; and are Carbon Offsets preferentially used over RECs?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: Of the over 800 institutions of higher education that have signed the Presidents’ Climate
Commitment, only 10 have announced carbon neutrality – and all 10 utilize Carbon Offsets. In fact, one school uses Carbon Offsets to mitigate all of their Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions (i.e., they use Carbon Offsets rather than RECs for offsetting their Scope 2 electricity purchases). On average, the 10 schools mitigate four times as much carbon with Carbon Offsets as they do with RECs.</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>11. Q: Because Carbon Offsets are project-based, are there other benefits to purchasing Carbon Offsets
over RECs?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: Many Carbon Offset projects address other societal shortcomings such as social and environmental
justice inequities. In fact, many of the 10 schools that have announced carbon neutrality combine their
social and environmental justice goals with their carbon reduction strategies when purchasing Carbon
Offsets. One of our favorite projects to support is Efficient Wood Cookstoves in Rwanda.</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>12. Q: Are Carbon Offsets useful in reducing methane emissions?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: <b><i>YES. COP 26 brought to light the importance of reducing methane emissions as methane’s 20-year
GWP (Global Warming Potential) is 84 to 87 times greater than CO<sub>2</sub> (Note: Methane emissions
currently rivals human CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for global warming impact).</i></b> Because Carbon Offsets are project
based, and are not limited to only renewable energy generation, projects have been developed that
reduce methane emissions. There are several methane-mitigation projects that are less than half the
cost of RECs on an equivalent carbon accounting basis.</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>13. Q: RECs vs Carbon Offsets: Which to buy?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: RECs came to fruition over 25 years ago. They were essential in raising the public’s awareness of
the benefits of renewable energy. But RECs don’t stand the test of additionality. Despite what we are
led to believe, there is no requirement for the money spent on RECs to be used for new renewable
energy projects being built. A couple of years ago, RECs were an insignificant cost – but no more. The
voluntary REC market is a $500 million per year business. Re-directing these funds to projects that
actually reduce atmospheric GHGs (i.e., Carbon Offset projects) would have an enormous benefit to
combating global climate change. Promoting the sale of RECs, which do little-to-nothing for the
environment, is not the best way to confront man-induced global climate change.</div>
<br>

<p class="accordion"><b>14. Q: Haven’t there been some problems of late with the efficacy of Carbon Offsets in actually reducing
GHG emissions?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A: While all Carbon Offset projects have to prove that the project being financed reduces carbon
emissions, there have been some questionable projects offered by others. For example, not cutting
down a stand of trees that weren’t going to be harvested does nothing to reduce global warming. We
constantly monitor the projects we offer to make sure that they make sense and are easy to
implement and scale. The Efficient Wood Cookstoves in Rwanda project is a good example –
additionality and resilience has been proven as 90+% of the cookstoves distributed are still in use five
years after project implementation</div>
