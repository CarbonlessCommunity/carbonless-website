        <h1>Carbonless Community’s On-line Reverse Auction
            <small> – In many states, communities can buy their electricity from renewable sources rather than purchasing electricity from the local utility.  In those states, Carbonless Community can help with the procurement process by utilizing their on-line reverse auction (a process endorsed by EPA Green Power Partners as a way of driving down the cost of green energy).

    <h4>Online Reverse Auctions for Energy Procurement</h4>
    <p class="lead"> We didn’t invent reverse auctions, but we thought long and hard about what information each participant in an auction – suppliers, auctioneer and client – would need to make the best online reverse auction available. Then we involved some of the best and brightest minds to turn our vision into reality. After months of testing to ensure the quality of our product, we rolled out our auction.</p>

    <p class="lead">In most auctions, buyers bid the price up as they compete with each other to secure a known product or service. In reverse auctions, the roles are switched, as vendors bid down a price to sell to a single buyer or buying group. Reverse auctions are most effective in purchasing commodities in markets where price transparency is lacking. Electricity procurement is a perfect reverse auction application.</p>

    <p class="lead">Technology has taken reverse auctions to a new level, providing additional value for consumers through the use of computers and the internet. Putting reverse auctions online allows suppliers from remote locations to effortlessly compete and secure business quickly. Sellers can continually assess their positions relative to their competitors, and cut margins where necessary to secure your business. Online reverse auctions not only reduce supplier margins further (thereby providing a lower price to consumers), but also reduce the size for economic transactions, bringing cost savings to more customers.</p>

    <h5>Shown below is a screen shot of what you, the client, will see at the conclusion of an auction.</h5>

    <h4>We Give You Choices</h4>
    <p class="lead">The creators of our online reverse auction platform have been working with customers for over 15 years in securing cost-effective energy for our clients’ facilities. We know that the auction is only one element in helping you reduce the energy expense line item in your budget. Our extensive experience issuing RFPs, evaluating responses, and analyzing contract terms and conditions adds to the value of our auction process, assuring that the most informed decisions are made.</p>

    <h4>Green Power Upgrade at No Cost</h4>
    <p class="lead"> Our recent experience on auctions we’ve conducted shows that the money saved by using an auction can completely offset the price premium for upgrading the entire purchase to green energy.</p>
