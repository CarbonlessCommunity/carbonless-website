                <small> – through Community Solar with Nexamp, you can save up to 20% on annual electric supply costs while truly supporting renewable energy in Illinois.

        <p class="lead">
        Every so often, we come across an <strong>energy-related opportunity</strong> for our clients that is outside our core business of
        assisting commercial, industrial and institutional customers with retail supply of electricity and natural gas. This is
        one of those times. This opportunity has to do with <strong>electricity supply for your home</strong>. You <strong>save
        money</strong> and you are <strong>truly supporting renewable energy in northern Illinois</strong>. I say “truly” because 
        until recently, retail electricity suppliers who
        state that they are selling you renewable energy are almost exclusively selling Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).
        Purchasing RECs from an established wind plant, located in some other state, changes nothing in the environment. These
        other electricity plans are still delivering 60% of your electricity from generators that burn coal and natural gas.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
        This opportunity is different. It’s electricity generation that comes from newly erected solar farms in Illinois under
        the Community Solar program. <strong>The solar-energy provider is Nexamp</strong>. Besides supporting the construction of these plants,
        their program offers several advantages:
        <ul class="lead">
        <li>You save <strong>20%</strong> compared to ComEd’s energy pricing for well into the future</li>
        <li>The program is available to all ComEd residential customers (including renters, and co-op and condo owners along with
        home owners)</li>
        <li>The agreement is no-risk, as you can cancel at anytime, and there are no fees</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead"> I’ve signed up for my own home. Starting January 1, 2021, I will be receiving solar powered electricity from a solar
        farm located in Harvard, Illinois. <strong>It was a good way of supporting renewable energy in Illinois</strong> without having to cut
        down the huge maple trees that provide summer shade to our house – and I’m saving 20%.
