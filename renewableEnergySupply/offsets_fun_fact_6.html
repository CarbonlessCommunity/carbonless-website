            <h3><i>Four out of Five Major Donors Prefer Carbon Offsets</i></h3><br><br>
            <p>Imagine you are at a cocktail party of potential major doners and one asks, <b>“So, what are we
doing about sustainability and how are you preparing our students for addressing the
existential environmental threat confronting them?”</b> Consider the following two responses:</p><br>

<p style="color:red;"><b>RESPONSE #1: “We are aggressively reducing our on-campus carbon footprint and we are purchasing
the environmental attributes from a 2010 North Dakota wind plant that is owned by an investment
bank and is operated by the local electric utility.” <br><br>
MAJOR DONOR’S FOLLOW-UP: “What’s an environmental attribute? You know what – on second
thought, I’m going to refresh my drink. You’ll have to excuse me."</b></p><br>
<p><b>OR........</b></p>
<br>
<p style="color:blue;"><b>RESPONSE #2: “We are aggressively reducing our on-campus carbon footprint and we are supporting
a carbon offset project in Rwanda that provides more efficient residential wood burning stoves that
not only halve daily carbon emissions, but also reduce the time women gather wood, thereby
allowing them more time with their families or finding other productive work.” <br><br>
MAJOR DONOR’S FOLLOW-UP: “Wow…that sounds interesting. Please tell me more about this
project. It sounds like it not only reduces our carbon footprint, but it also addresses social and
environmental justice issues – something that I bet is near and dear to our students.”</b></p><br>
<h3><i>Which conversation would you prefer to have?</i></h3>
