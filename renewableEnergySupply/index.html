            <p>&quot;If chosen correctly, Carbon Offsets can be an effective way to mitigate your carbon

            price and effectiveness when buying offsets to reach your carbon reduction goals.”</p>

        <p>With many corporations and institutions having well-established processes for decarbonizing their electricity purchases (i.e., Scope 2 emissions), proactive entities are now moving on to addressing Scope 1 and Scope 3 GHG emissions.  While this may seem like a daunting task, our investigation shows that emissions from using fossil fuels for building heating and transportation can be mitigated at <b><i>less than half the cost of offsetting current electricity purchases. </b></i>
<br><br><br>
 

In response to our findings, Carbonless Community has joined forces with UCapture.  The goal of our effort is to offer carbon mitigation alternatives that better meet our clients’ environmental and social justice goals in a more cost-effective manner. 

 <br><br><br>

We only offer Carbon Offsets.  And because we only sell Carbon Offsets (and not RECs), we work to match the underlying project with your environmental goals and objectives.  From us you don’t just get a generic carbon offset.  With our projects you get to know not only the amount of carbon offset, but you also get to see who the local beneficiaries of the project are and how it enhances their lives.  On UCapture’s website, there over 25 carbon-reducing projects in locations around the world.  We endeavor to provide Carbon Offsets that are sustainable and resilient over the long term; and all projects are independently verified by the Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve and others.

The following are some of the current projects we support:<br><br></p>
