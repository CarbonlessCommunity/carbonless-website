            <h3><i>Buying RECs to reduce Scope 2 emissions won’t reduce Methane
Emissions - But Buying the “Right” Carbon Offset Will</i></h3><br><br>
            <p>Last Tuesday, world leaders at COP 26 pledged to sharply curtail methane (CH4)
emissions. We all know that CH4 is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) – but what many don’t
appreciate is the magnitude of the impact that methane emissions have in the near-term on
warming our planet. Methane has a 20-year Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 84-
87. Doing some simple arithmetic on the amount of annual methane emitted and its near-
term GWP, one will discover that CH4 emissions equal human’s CO2 emissions in
contributing to global warming this year. But the situation is not as dire as you may think –
there is positive action you can take to reduce CH4 emissions – but it requires a little
modification in your purchasing behavior.</p>
<p>
    Both RECs and Carbon Offsets can mitigate Scope 2 emissions in your carbon footprint
accounting. Unlike RECs, there are several Carbon Offset projects that reduce
CH4 emissions. By purchasing the “Right” Carbon Offsets rather than RECs for reducing
your Scope 2 emissions, you can select a methane-reducing project that has positive real-
world implications. And here’s an additional benefit for those on constrained budgets
– <b>purchasing the equivalent amount of Carbon Offsets will cost you half</b> as much as
purchasing RECs.
